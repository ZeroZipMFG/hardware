## Product Background

After many years in the trades ([click here](https://github.com/ZeroZipMFG/team/blob/main/benhammer.md) for details on my background) I had found a few pain points with how I carried my tools.

One of the biggest issues was my mini-impact driver. The thing was constantly floating around to different parts of my toolbelt, ending up in different pouches, blocking easy access to other tools, and causing unnecessary strain on my back when it was stored in its normal spot in the left pouch (reaching your right hand across your body and down to your left hip 100s of times per day can't be good for your back in the longrun) 

So, I set out to find a solution.

At first, I really just wanted to buy something that would solve my problem, so I bought a couple of the options that were available on the market. I quickly found that the "universal" style impact-driver holsters were just not the solution I was looking for. I kept searching, to see if someone would make what I was looking for, a more form fitting, lighter weight option, but never found one.

## Product Development

I had a bit of a background working with leather, for wallets and similar items, so it was the obvious material to work with here. I made the first prototype (I will add photos here in the future) and was excited and proud of the results, but sorely disappointed with the performance and functionality. The gun would get stuck in the holster, or be difficult to reinsert, so I shelved the idea for a while and went back to my uncomfortable ways of storing and using my impact driver.

A couple months went by, and I had a spark of inspiration to make the original prototype better. So I went for it.

This version was much, much better, and I actually made use of it for around 6 months in my day to day work. Unfortunately, the leather started to soften, and lose its original wet-formed shape, so it just wasn't that great any longer.

Luckily, there was another material which I had been interested in playing with for a long time, and was part of the original design docs of the holsters from way back when I first started the process.

That material being Kydex thermoform plastic.

Kydex has been in use in firearm holsters and blade sheaths for a long time, and does its job very well.

## Kydex Holster Alpha v1.0

So here we are, about 3 days ago I received all the materials I would need, and got to work.

The first model (Alpha v1.0 - pictured above) took me pretty long to make, as I was figuring out an entirely different material and process, but when I finally completed it...

Man I was stoked! This thing is awesome, lightweight, sturdy, easy to draw and stow, and makes a very satisfying *click* when the impact driver is stowed. Also no straps needed to hold the gun in, as it indexes well so there is excelent retention (while being easy to pull it out.)

## Product Release

ZeroZipMFG's maker, Ben Hammer, is excited to release this product - along with all design documentation and instructions - very very soon. If you are interested in making one for yourself, watchlist this repo to be updated when further info drops! ~~If you aren't interested in making one yourself, and would like to help fund ZeroZipMFG so Ben can make these for you, keep an eye out for the soon to launch [crowdfunding campaign](https://github.com/ZeroZipMFG/hardware/blob/main/zz_toolholsters/docs/zz_holster-desc-latest.md) (link will be updated on launch), where you can do just that!~~

I don't really want to crowdfund this actually. Mostly just want to get the files up and available for others who want to make. I can definitely make these for anyone who doesn't want to make themselves, but production would be limited. If you want one made for this specific gun (Milwaukee 2553-20 M12 Impact Driver) [email me](mailto:zerozip@tuta.com)

As for the documentation which I've promised, I am still working on compiling everything, but have been very busy trying to make ends meet. I really want to release all docs as complete as possible all in one go, but may change my mind in the days to come. Once again, keep an eye on this repo if you are interested. Thanks.
